<h2 class="item5">Uploading template </h2>

<p>In order to make your site "live", you need to upload all the content of "<strong>site</strong>" folder from your
    local computer to your hosting server.</p>

<p>Please note: your website root depends on the directory structure on your hosting server. If you upload the
    &quot;<strong>site</strong>&quot; folder itself into your server, the root to your website will be <strong>http://your_domain_name/site</strong>.
    To avoid this and make the website root <strong>http://your_domain_name/</strong> please open the
    &quot;<strong>site</strong>&quot; folder and upload the folder content. </p>
